# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Project Description

This project is a simple car sales dashboard template built with React and Material-UI (MUI). It serves as a basic example of how to create a car sales management panel. The template showcases a minimal yet functional design, suitable for demonstrating a basic React setup with MUI components.
